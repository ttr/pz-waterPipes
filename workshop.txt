title=Irrigation pipes for farming and water supply [B41+]
description=Irrigation pipes for farming and water supply. Fixed for B41+
description=
description=You can craft an irrigation pipe from a regular pipe, any hammer and a screwdriver.
description=You can put this pipe on the ground next to a water barrel, every field on which a pipe is located counts as watered.
description=However, after sowing the seeds, you have to manually water the fields at least once!
description=The irrigation system will remember this value and then automatically supply the fields with the set amount of water.
description=Some plants need less water and when it rains the water level rises above the set amount!
description=The irrigation system cannot distinguish whether the user or the rain is watering to full 100% water level.
description=A roof should be built over these fields.
description=If you want to connect a sink or washing machine, note the following.
description=It only works in a closed room, windows are ok, a door, a roof. It doesn't work outside.
description=The barrel must be one level higher and a field behind the sink / washing machine. You can then connect it with a pipe wrench.
description=Water barrels that are connected to one another with the pipes share the amount of water, regardless of whether on the floor or on a roof.
description=This allows you to store huge amounts of (fresh) water, whether for the washbasin (clean) or for the garden (dirty) when it has not rained for a long time.
description=Pipes that have been laid can also be picked up again.
description=If you want to remove an already laid pipe, right click the pipe and choose "remove pipe", dont use a sledgehammer or such.

description=Original Text:
description=Introduces a new item, Irrigation pipes, that allows you to lay garden hoses over your crops.
description=If you place them next to a Water barrel or piped water source (faucets, baths, toilets... but not wells, lakes or rivers) it will periodically irrigate your farm every ingame hour to maintain its current water level.
description=If you cant find irrigation pipes, you can craft them from any kind of pipe (or hoses if you use Hydrocraft instead of this mod).
description=Now this mod also includes Russian and Spanish translations. Thanks to Lord Hobotok for suggesting to add them, the help in doing so, and the Russian translation.
description=Contact me if you want to add your own language.
